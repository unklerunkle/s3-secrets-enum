This tool was built as part of an exercise to learn more about AWS Authentication Mechanisms using Boto3

This idea came from PwnedLabs doing the lab "Understand Authentication Mechanisms Using Boto3" created by Joe Helle

I decided to take the hard coded credentials out of the equation and call the profile and the bucket as an argument.

There are also more functionality updates such as creating a directory of the bucket name and saving the files into that directory
